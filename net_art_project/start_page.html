            <h2>Artist Statment</h2>

                <h4>My generated phrase/source of inspiration, “The Major Strawberry Conflict Has Nobility Implications.” led me to an out of the box concept involving the story of Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet as strawberries. The words in particular that led me to this concept were “nobility” and conflict”. The reference felt too obvious to not utilize. I wanted to start my piece off with something that appeared simple, but was complex in structure. So, I took an image of a zoomed in strawberry and made some of the small seeds within it clickable. From there, the various pages recount the tragic story of two young lovers, who also happen to be strawberries. I highlight the moment they meet, both of their individual deaths, as well as two pages reflecting on the poetry within their suffering.
