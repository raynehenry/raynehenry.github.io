                <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
                <p>
                    For this project, I created three collages using Photoshop and found images to create a
                    triptych that reveals and reflects upon my mind, body, and spirit.
                    The first part of the triptych that shows my mind, is starkly different from the other two
                    pieces. As my mind is frequently convoluted and constantly working, I decided to bring that into
                    the composition, and make it feel more busy. For the body collage, I brought in a lot of
                    symbolism that is near and dear to my heart. I also brought in images that encapsulate the
                    confusion that I often feel surrounding my body and self image. As for the final piece on my
                    spirit, I intentionally made it more simple and easier on the eye in order to get the idea across
                    about how much I feel at peace when it comes to my spirit. When I am able it free myself from
                    the constraints and stressors of my mind and body, I feel like I can fly, as the collage portrays.
                    The three pieces don’t appear to have the same, or even a similar, style, however I feel like that
                    adds to my narrative that the mind, body, and spirit, often don’t align. In my case, they don’t. The
                    way that I feel in my mind differs from my body and spirit, and vice versa.
                    Overall the three collages are an accurate, visual representation of my mind, body, and
                    spirit. The lack of cohesion that may be felt among the three pieces, is actually a great way to
                    portray the idea that the mind, body, and spirit are three different entities, despite their inherit
                    interconnectedness.
